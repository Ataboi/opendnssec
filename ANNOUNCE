Dear OpenDNSSEC community,

Today we want to enter the final steps towards the 2.0 release by
handing out the first real beta.  The development is complete, testing
has completed and we have no bugs around that would stop you replacing
1.4 with 2.0.

Download it here:
  https://dist.opendnssec.org/source/testing/opendnssec-2.0.0b1.tar.gz

The new version features a complete re-write of the enforcer, adding
some features and guarantees to not let your zone go bogus even when
modifying critical parameters.

Instead of focusing on the new we would like to know if your current
uses are satisfied with this release.  This version is new and shiny,
has new things, but we have more in store.  This as soon as we can
finalize this new baseline version that marks the final transition of
OpenDNSSEC to the NLNET Labs supported stack.

We hope that with your feedback we can make rapid cycles towards a
quick final release.  After the 2.0 release proper, we plan to have a
more incremental development releasing several times a year with new
features and bug fixes to prevent such a long cycle as 2.0 had.

Some heads-up when trying it out after being used to 1.4:
- Scripted migration from 1.4 to 2.0 available, see MIGRATION file;
- Use command ods-enforcer-db-setup rather than "ods-ksmutil setup";
- Any other use of ods-ksmutil is replaced with the ods-enforcer command,
  which at the moment requires the enforcer daemon to be running;
- Use ods-enforcer zone add and delete rather than modifying the
  zonelist.xml file yourself.  This file is not kept up-to-date
  automatically anymore;
- to start using OpenDNSSEC, use ods-enforcer policy import instead
  of update kasp to update your policies;
